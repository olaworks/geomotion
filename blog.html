                            <p> Amethyst crystals are one of the world’s most popular gemstones and have been in use for thousands of years. The believed healing properties of the stone are rather impressive and trace back to ancient Greek beliefs. In fact, the word ‘amethyst’ comes from the Greek word amethystos, which means sober and alludes to the idea of maintaining a solid, sober mindset.

                                If you love purple gemstones, or have always wanted to know more about amethyst, now’s your chance. We’ve rounded up everything there is to know about this regal gem, from the meaning of amethyst, to its healing properties.
                                
                                What Is Amethyst?

                                Amethysts forms in long, prismatic crystals in geodes or hollow rocks. These geodes form when there are cavities in volcanic rock. As the rock cools, the mineral-saturated water, gases and volcanic material distil and crystallize. When these crystals harden, they form amethyst. Although generally more of a deeper purple, the stone can also have a reddish-purple tinge, or a very pale purple tinge that fades into a lilac.
                                
                                Natural amethyst has been used for personal adornment for at least 2000 years, while synthetic version is far newer, and not as common.
                                
                                As the member of the quartz family characterised by their distinctive purple colour, amethyst has a hardness of seven on the Mohs scale. Amethyst gems are durable, and this makes them ideal for all kinds of jewellery. You’ll often find amethyst in earrings, pendants, bracelets, and rings and it’s even cut to create bracelet cuffs or beads too.
                                
                                
                                
                                Due to its hardness and durability, the stone can be cut into a variety of shapes, making it all the more versatile. Faceted pieces, beds and cabochons are just a few of the more common cuts.
                                
                                You can find high quality naturally formed amethyst in Sri Lanka, Siberia, Brazil, Uruguay, Namibia and the Far East, as well as large deposits in Namibia, Australia and America. The largest cache of this gem is found in South America.
                                
                                When it comes to the price, the value of an amethyst stone depends on a number of factors, including the size of the stone and the depth of its colour.
